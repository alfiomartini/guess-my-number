# Guess my Number

This is a simple app that allows the user to guess a secret number randomly generated by the program. The user interact with the application by trying to guess the secret number a limited amount of times. The program guides the user to the appropriate answer, by printing messages that state if the guess is bigger or smaller than the correct number. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Hugo Di Francesco (Professional JavaScript) and it is developed entirely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
